make_movie
==========
This repository contains a Python script that will take all images in a directory and make a time-lapse movie. EXIF data is utilized to determine the date the picture was taken and that date is printed on each of the images in the movie.

The maximum width and height, frame rate, temporary image directory, and output filename are all configurable from the command line.

A separate script to test resizing images is also included.
